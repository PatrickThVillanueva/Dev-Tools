# Dev Tools

This repo will contain tools that I use both in private and on my working machine.
This automates the installation of a clean Windows machine, personalized to myself, using Powershell.

## Usage

1. Run: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
2. Update "Machine Setup.ps1", "InstallApps.psm1" or "SetupPowerShellProfile.ps1" if necessary.
3. Run "Machine Setup.ps1" as an admin.
